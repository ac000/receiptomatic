We welcome outside contributions to this project. There is no copyright
assignment policy.

If you would like to contribute code, documentation etc, then please make sure
your patches or pull request commits are 'signed-off'.

This means adding a line that says "Signed-off-by: Name <email>" at the end of
each commit, indicating that you wrote the code and have the right to pass it
on as an open source patch.

See: https://developercertificate.org/

Also, please write good git commit messages. A good commit message
looks like this:

	Header line: explaining the commit in one line

	Body of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things
	in more detail, possibly giving some background about the issue
	being fixed, etc etc.

	The body of the commit message can be several paragraphs, and
	please do proper word-wrap and keep columns shorter than about
	74 characters or so. That way "git log" will show things
	nicely even when it's indented.

	Reported-by: whoever-reported-it
	Signed-off-by: Your Name <youremail@yourhost.com>

where that header line really should be meaningful, and really should be
just one line. That header line is what is shown by tools like gitk and
shortlog, and should summarise the change in one readable line of text,
independently of the longer explanation.

Also, new code should follow the coding style used, this is basically the
coding style used in the linux kernel and is documented here:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/plain/Documentation/process/coding-style.rst?id=HEAD

or directly in the Documentation/process/coding-style.rst file in your kernel
source tree.

Contributions can be mailed directly to the current maintainer via:
Andrew Clayton <ac@sigsegv.uk>

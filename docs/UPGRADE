Upgrading
=========

Upgrading the application should generally be as a simple as stopping it,
copying the updated executable, templates and css etc into place and then
starting the application back up.


Database schema changes
-----------------------

However, there are occasions where the database schema may have changed,
though these should be rare.

The mysqldiff perl module/cli, http://adamspiers.org/computing/mysqldiff/.
can be a big help in updating the database schema. You can run it against
the database and the latest schema file and it will output a list of MySQL
commands to update the database e.g

    $ mysqldiff --host=HOST --user=USER --password=PASS <DATABASE> <SCHEMA>

and will output something like:

    ALTER TABLE images ADD INDEX processed (processed);

There is one thing to watch out for. If a column has been renamed, it has
no way of knowing that's what happened as opposed to a column being dropped
and a column being added.

So instead of seeing a single

    ALTER TABLE ... CHANGE COLUMN ...

you'll get an

    ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN ...
    ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ...

pair, which you should change into a single ALTER TABLE ... CHANGE COLUMN ...
statement.

If in doubt of such situations, you can use git log -p db/receiptomatic.sql
to see exactly what's changed and by looking at the db/receiptomatic.sql
file, you'll see exactly what the current state should be.
